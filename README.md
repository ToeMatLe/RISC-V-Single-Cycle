RISC-V Single-Cycle Processor (RV32I)

This project implements a single-cycle RV32I RISC-V processor in SystemVerilog, along with a comprehensive testbench that verifies instruction execution, control flow, memory access, and jump/branch behavior.

The design follows the classic single-cycle datapath model taught in computer architecture courses and is simulated using Xilinx Vivado.
