rsicv - instruction set 
- creates machine code to output


sequential - give inputs, wait till next clock edge for outputs
    always_ff @(posedge clk) begin
        hogoqhrgoqehrgoqhoghogh
    end
    - only use if you need a past input to decide your current input
    - everything in the sequential block is updated at once on the clock edge when using non-blocking operator
combinational - give inputs, get outputs hopefully by the next clock edge
    always_comb () begin
        aghiorghoiagoihrg
    end
    - use blocking operator, just =
    - how you make paralelism
    - GPUs nowadays do important operations in parallel (matmul, convolution) -> systolic array
    - cant use non-blocking operators in combinational period
    - cant use previous values in combinatonal (inferred latch) ALWAYS SIGN DEFULT VALUES


Non-blocking <= :
is used in sequential logic, all non-blocking operations happen at the clock edge (note uses values in previous clock cycles)
this happens on clock edge. Helps with paralelism
inputRegA <= inputA;
inputRegB <= inputB;
multiplyReg = inputAReg * inputBReg

critical path:
- longest combinational path
- limiter or clk frequency
*longer combinational time gives more time for say paralelism, if everything was 1ns, its the idea of software

Clock Cycle 1: get inputs from a buffer -> decide which inputs to use -> pass those inputs to the array -> register inputs 4 ns
Clock Cycle 2: get inputs from register -> multiplier -> output, 4ns

longer one
Clock Cycle 1: get inputs from a buffer -> decide which inputs to use -> pass those inputs to the array -> inputs would be multiplied together 8 ns
f = 1 / T = 125 MHz
multiplyReg <= inputA * inputB;

can use (Quartus, vivado) for:
-behavioral simulations -> test the correctess of code (can your code execute?) 
-synthesizing -> try to see if the code can go on the fpga 
    -testbenches dont work, tests to see if meets clk frequecy, power draw, puts your .sv files ito hardware

instruction set (feed machine code -> does operation)
program counter -> stores the address of current instruction
instruction memory for storing instructions in registers
    registers; can move, empty, change (MUTABLE)
data memory
    we have to read and write explicity

this jumps to an address if a condition happens
beq x1, x0, 0x8 // 0x0
dummy instruction // 0x4
dummy instruction // 0x8
